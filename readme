    Created by by Jakeliny (Fcamara)

Software content:
    Typescript - Using CommonJS
    MongoDB (mongoose)
    Nodejs with:
        express
        Using Typescript we need to install modules for Typescript (@types/express, @types/node, @types/mongoose, ts-node, Typescript)
        *using -D in the final to tell that these packages is only for development

Steps:
1-Create our application(app.ts)
2-Create our server(server.ts)
3-Create our database(db.ts) to set Mangoose conection an answers for our url
4-Create our structure(model.ts)(Our collection is equal to table)
5-Create our way to send/call data (controller.ts)
6-Create a "route" to show content = selectOne



*Comments:
    In package.json file, if using windows u need to add "SET" at the beggining of start script and "&" after the NODE (U can use cross-env too)
    U need to install MongoDB and run a server with same name that u declare on db.ts file
    In API we always need to use a (req, res)
