Software content:
    Typescript - Using CommonJS
    MongoDB (mongoose)
    Nodejs with:
        express
        Using Typescript we need to install modules for Typescript (@types/express, @types/node, @types/mongoose, ts-node, Typescript)
        *using -D in the final to tell that these packages is only for development

Comments:
    In package.json file, if using windows u need to add "SET" at the beggining of start script and "&" after the NODE (U can use cross-env too)
